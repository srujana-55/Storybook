Farmer Fred had just bought a new bull.
He named him Bill.
Bill was a strong and handsome bull with
great horns. He was very big for his age.
Farmer Fred got Bill, the bull loaded into
the trailer, and headed back home to his
farm. When they arrived, Farmer Fred
said, “Bill, welcome to your new home.” Bill
just snorted and tossed his head backshow off his impressive horns.

This was all new to Bill as he was raised
in a small stall and his new home was very
different. He had a lot to explore.
Bill stood on the hill and watched all the
barnyard animals. He thought to himself. “I am
the biggest animal on Farmer Fred’s farm. No
other animal has such great horns."

Bill chuckled at the chickens as he slowly
walked up to them. They were so small
and they didn’t have horns.
As Bill approached, the chickens clucked.
The lone duck, ducked, as Bill almost
stepped on her.

Bill lowered his head and quickly shook it from side to
side right in front of the chickens.
“I’m Bill, the bull and I’m bigger than you chubby
chickens,” he said in a deep voice. “And I am the boss
of the barnyard.”
Bill, the bull, frightened the chickens. They rapidly
ran, flipped, flopped and, flew, to the safety of their
cozy coupe. This made Bill, the bull, laugh loudly. He
was having fun.

Bill saw some plump pigs moving in the mud
and decided to play a prank.
As he approached, he said loudly, “I heard Farmer
Fred say that he needed some bacon for breakfast
and ham for dinner.” He then laughed loudly and
tossed his head around showing off his great horns.

This frightened many of the pigs and they
proceeded to their pen for protection.
The biggest pig, named Pork Chop, walked up to
Bill and said.
“You are a very mean bull, Bill.”
Bill snorted a reply.
“Well, you have a big, flat nose,
a tornado tail and pink ears.
Also, you are dirty, and smelly”
Then Bill lowered his head, snorted
 a great snort,
and shook his horns at Pork Chop.

Pork Chop was a wise old pig and knew what Bill
was doing.
He wouldn’t be bullied by any bull, even Bill.
Now, Bill, the bullying bull, was expecting Pork
Chop to mush through the mud and proceed to
the pen for protection.
But Pork Chop just stood there looking at him.
Then Pork Chop said in a soft voice.
“You are a very mean bull, Bill,”
and walked away

Then, Bill saw some sheep in the meadow. Bill
began to walk across the big barnyard towards
them. When he got there, he was met by the
Roger Ram, the leader of the flock.“I’m Roger
Ram, rejoicing at meeting my newest neighbor on
Farmer Fred’s farm,”
he said in a very polite manner.
Bill ran at Roger Ram, snorting and shaking his big
horns and said, “I am Bill, the bull.
I am the boss of the barnyard.”
In a split second, Roger Ram, rammed Bill the
bullying bull, between his big horns.

Bill, the bullying bull, looked at Roger Ram and
said. “All that white curly hair, might give you
lots of flair, but you ram like a ewe.”
Then Bill backed up, started to paw at the
ground with his hefty hooves, snorted seven
snorts, shook his horns, lowered his now lumpy
head, and…………
Roger Ram and the others retreated from the
meadow. Bill, the bullying bull, was proud of
what he had done.

All the barnyard animals were afraid of Bill.
He was either threatening them with his size
and big horns or making fun of the way they
looked.
It was not a pleasant day on Farmer Fred’s farm.
“I am going to call him Bully Bill,”
said Henrietta Hen.

“That’s not nice,” responded Roy Rooster. “It’s
being a bully yourself.”
“Well, we will work on something to stop his
bullying,” replied Toby Turtle.
Roger Ram said, “I don’t know what we can do?
I rammed him and he called me a ewe.”

Dorothy Duck said, “He almost stepped on me
with those heavy hooves. No one is safe!”
With tears in her eyes, little Patty Piglet said,
“I heard, I was going to be eaten by Farmer Fred.
I’m scared.”
Pork Chop said in a soft and soothing tone, “Don’t
worry my friends. By the evening feed by Farmer
Fred, Bill, the bullying bull, will become our buddy.”

Bill was having so much fun. He certainly was
the boss of the barnyard.
He looked around and saw a big barn, with open
doors, and he just had to let whoever lived there
know that he was boss of the barnyard.
It was a bright sunny day but as Bill walked into the
dark barn, he couldn’t see anything.
This frightened him a little.
He turned the corner around the door and … BOOM
… he was stopped in mid stride. Bill realized that he
had just walked into something really big. So big, it
didn’t move when he walked into it.

As Bill’s eyes adjusted to the darkness in the
barn, he started to see what had stopped him. He
was looking at the chest of some big animal.
Bill was scared.
As he looked up, he could see the biggest bull,
with the biggest horns, staring down at him. A
voice like thunder filled the barn. “I finally get to
meet Bill, the boss of the barnyard.”
Now Bill didn’t know what to do or what to say. All
he could do was look up at this giant and wonder
what would happen next.
There was silence in the barn for several minutes
as Bill just looked up in amazement. Finally, the
big bull said something.

“I am Brian Bull and have lived on Farmer Fred’s
farm for many, many, years. In all those years,
never have the other animals asked me for help.
But today, they came to me with the story of
a big bull that was bullying them and they asked me
to put an end to it. I agreed!”
Bill was never, ever, so frightened. Brian could toss
him across the barnyard, with little effort, and one
push from his head. Brian slowly lowered his head.
Bill looked down and began to shake.
Brian got closer and whispered into Bill’s ear.
“What do you think I should do, Bill? I promised
the other animals I would put a stop to your
bullying.” 

“Please believe me Brian. You have!” Bill said in a
truly honest voice.
“I have never been so frightened in my life
and I know how the other animals must have
felt.” Bill began to sob a little.
“I now know how it feels to be bullied and you
didn’t even really bully me. I have learned my
lesson and I will go out and apologize to
all the animals and ask them to forgive me

“You don’t have to,” Brian said.
“You already have.”
As Bill turned around, he saw all the
other animals standing in the doorway.

“Here pig-pig-pig, come on
chick-chick ….”
The animals heard Farmer
Fred calling them for the
evening feed.

Pork Chop walked over to
Bill and said.
“Come on, buddy. Let’s eat.”
